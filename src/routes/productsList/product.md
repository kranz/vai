Lovely is the feeling now Fever temperatures rising now
Power ah power is the force the vow
That makes it happen It asks no questions why ooh
So get closer closer now to my body now
Just love me till you don't know how ooh
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough

Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain't nothing like a love desire
Hoo I'm melting I'm melting
like hot candle wax
Sensation ah sensation

So let love
take us through the hours

Cause this is love power ooh
Keep onwith the force don't stop
Don't stopâ€¦
